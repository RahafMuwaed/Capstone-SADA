## 📖 Project Overview

One of the major challenges during Hajj and Umrah seasons is the difficulty of understanding the **Maghrebi Arabic dialect** in Saudi Arabia, which can create communication barriers between visitors from Morocco and local service providers.  

**SADA** is an intelligent system designed to solve this issue by:  
- 🏨 Helping visitors search for and book hotels based on their preferred prices and features.  
- 🧳 Generating personalized travel plans according to the city, type of trip, and number of days.  
- ❓ Answering general questions related to their journey.  
- 🌐 Automatically translating from Maghrebi Arabic dialect into Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) to ensure smooth communication.  

This way, SADA enhances the overall experience of pilgrims and visitors from Morocco by making services more accessible and seamless.
