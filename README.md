# Capstone-SADA 🎓

**Smart Arabic Dialects Agent (SADA)** — Capstone project that bridges the gap between **Arabic dialects** and **Modern Standard Arabic (MSA)**.  
SADA integrates **machine translation**, **speech recognition**, and **intelligent agents** to support users in real-world scenarios such as **trip planning** and **hotel booking**.

## 📖 Project Overview
One of the major challenges during Hajj and Umrah seasons is the difficulty of understanding the Maghrebi Arabic dialect in Saudi Arabia, which can create communication barriers between visitors from Morocco and local service providers.

SADA is an intelligent system designed to solve this issue by:
	•	🏨 Helping visitors search for and book hotels based on their preferred prices and features.
	•	🧳 Generating personalized travel plans according to the city, type of trip, and number of days.
	•	❓ Answering general questions related to their journey.
	•	🌐 Automatically translating from Maghrebi Arabic dialect into Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) to ensure smooth communication.

This way, SADA enhances the overall experience of pilgrims and visitors from Morocco by making services more accessible and seamless.
